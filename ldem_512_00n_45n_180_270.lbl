DESCRIPTION               = "This data product is a rectangular 
   subsection (tile) of a global shape map (radius) of the Moon 
   at a resolution of 512 pix/deg by 512 pix/deg, based on 
   altimetry data acquired through mission phase LRO_ES_21
   by the LOLA instrument. Preliminary LOLA data used for the generation of 
   previous GDR products is replaced by data geolocated using precision 
   orbits based on a revised lunar gravity field GRGM 900C [LEMOINEETAL2014].

   Ground tracks were interpolated using the Generic Mapping Tools programs 
   'surface' and 'grdblend'.  The map is in the form of a binary table with 
   one row for each  0.0019531250 degrees of latitude, pixel
   registered.  Map values are relative to a radius of 1737.4 km.

   This label describes an IMG file in the form of a binary 
   resampling to pixel registration.
